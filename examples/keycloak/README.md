# Keycloak example

Runs a real [keycloak-extension-oid4vp](https://github.com/ba-itsys/keycloak-extension-oid4vp)
verifier against this wallet simulator. The setup downloads the released extension jar from
Maven Central. Override the version with EXTENSION_VERSION when running setup.sh.

## Layout

Keycloak runs in Docker on port 8080 with the imported `wallet-demo` realm. The realm configures
the `oid4vp` identity provider with HAIP settings (`x509_hash`, `direct_post.jwt`) and a wallet
URL of `http://localhost:8081/authorize`. That is a plain web URL without a custom scheme. An
`etsi-trust-list` identity provider points at the simulator's credentials trust list.

The simulator runs on the host on port 8081. Its base URL is `host.docker.internal:8081` so
Keycloak can fetch the trust list and the status list from inside the container.

## Run it

```sh
# 1. Start the simulator (from the repository root)
SERVER_PORT=8081 APP_BASEURL=http://host.docker.internal:8081 mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Download the extension jar, create the verifier certificate,
#    fetch a registration certificate from the simulator, render the realm
./setup.sh

# 3. Start Keycloak
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080/realms/wallet-demo/account/> and choose **Sign in with Wallet**, then
**Open wallet**. The browser lands on the simulator's credential picker. Present a credential and
the login completes with the disclosed claims mapped to the Keycloak user.

The realm requests two credential types, a PID and a health insurance credential, as a credential
set in optional mode. The verifier therefore accepts either one, and the picker lets you choose
which credential type to answer with. Both types are part of the simulator's default wallet
content.

The admin console is at <http://localhost:8080/admin> with user `admin` and password `admin`.

## Trying revocation

```sh
# Revoke Maria's PID. The verifier checks the status list on every login.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/credentials/pid-maria-neumann/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status": 1}'
```

The next login with that credential fails at the verifier. Reactivate with `{"status": 0}`.

## Smoke test

`./smoke-test.sh` drives the full same device login headlessly with curl and prints PASS or FAIL.
